### Features
The program implements the following key methods:
1. **Recursive Site Selection**: Selects hospital sites based on available budget and district coverage.
2. **Budget Management**: Ensures selected sites do not exceed the allocated budget.
3. **District Coverage**: Avoids double-counting of districts when calculating total coverage.

### Input
- **Hospital Sites**: Each site includes a name, cost, and a set of districts covered.

### Output
- **Selected Sites**: A list of sites selected to maximize district coverage without exceeding the budget.

## Instructions
1. Implement a recursive function for selecting hospital sites.
2. Ensure the solution optimizes both district coverage and budget constraints.
3. Use recursive calls to explore possible combinations of sites.
4. Test and debug the solution to handle various edge cases.
